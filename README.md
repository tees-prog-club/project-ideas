# Teesside Programming Club Project Ideas Repository

Welcome to Teesside Programming Club's Project Ideas Repository! This repository is a central hub where members of the programming club can share, explore, and contribute project ideas spanning various domains such as C++, problem-solving, web development, and more.

## Contents

- `_template.md` - Template for submitting new project ideas.
- `cpp/` - C++ related project ideas.
- `problem-solving/` - General problem-solving project ideas.
- `web/` - Web-based project ideas.

## How to Submit a Project Idea

If you have a project idea that you believe will benefit the club members, we encourage you to share it by following these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repo on your GitHub account where you can make changes.

2. **Create Your Project Idea File**: Navigate to the appropriate directory for your project idea. If your project is related to C++, go to the `cpp/` directory. For problem-solving ideas, use the `problem-solving/` directory, and for web-related projects, use the `web/` directory. If your project does not fit into these categories, feel free to create your own folder.

3. **Use the Template**: Copy the contents of `_template.md` to start your project idea file. Rename your file to describe your project idea succinctly, such as `your-project-name.md`.

4. **Fill Out the Template**: Replace the placeholder information in `_template.md` with the details of your project. Be sure to include:
   - **Student(s)'s name(s), ID, and GitHub username(s)**: List the names, student IDs, and GitHub usernames of all project contributors.
   - **Short description of project**: Provide a brief description of what the project entails.
   - **Technologies used for this project**: List the programming languages, frameworks, and tools you intend to use.
   - **Motivation to do this project**: Explain why you and your team are interested in pursuing this project.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: After filling out the template, commit your new project idea file to your forked repository. Make sure your commit message is clear and descriptive.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've committed your project idea, submit a pull request to the original repository. In your pull request, provide a summary of your project idea and why it would be a valuable addition to the repository.

7. **Wait for Review**: The repository maintainers will review your submission. This process may involve some discussion, and you may be asked to make revisions based on feedback. Once your submission is approved, it will be merged into the main repository, and your project idea will be officially listed.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your project idea is unique and not a duplicate of existing entries.
- Provide clear and concise information in your submission.
- Be open to feedback and willing to make requested changes.

## Questions or Suggestions

If you have any questions about the submission process or suggestions on how we can improve the repository, feel free to open an issue or contact a repository maintainer directly.
