#Short description of project

[A blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks. Essentially,
blockchain is a method of recording data - a digital ledger of transactions, agreements, contracts - anything that needs to be independently recorded and verified as having happened.
The big difference is that this ledger isn't stored in one place, it's distributed across several, hundreds or even thousands of computers around the world (see [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35370304)).

[Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a token called ether.

This project is all about discovering more about this technology! In particular, the idea is to develop a web service based on the Ethereum Blockchain. As a starting point, investigate the service [Lottereo](http://lottereo.com) and [its implementation](https://github.com/glynnbird/lottereum). One of the authors, Glynn Bird will visit us and deliver a guest talk!

Alternatively, you can also investigate [Ascribe's API](http://docs.ascribe.apiary.io) and develop services on top os [Ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io). The focus on Ascribe would be particularly relevant for Computer Games programmers.

#Technologies used for this project

Blockchain

#Motivation to do this project

Blockchain is causing a stir around the world and promises to revolutionise many current transactional services. It is likely that the technology will be prevalent in a few years time. By learning how to develop services based on Blockchain now will give you a competitive advantage.
