## Short description of project

[The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](http://llvm.org/) is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
This project is all about learning more about this infrastructure and, in particular, learning how to write [LLVM passes](http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html). 

Getting started:

 1. [Write an Hello World pass](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring08/cs259/llvm-2.2/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html)
 2. [Write a simple program analysis](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15745-s09/www/assignments/1/assign1.html)

## Technologies used for this project

C++

## Motivation to do this project

Understanding how LLVM works and being able to write program analyses will help you improve your programming skills. Moreover, [LLVM is used in many high-profile commercial projects](http://llvm.org/Users.html), meaning that you will also acquire employability skills. Finally, if you learn how to write program analyses, you may end up collaborating with some of our researchers in the topic.
