## Short description of project

[SESHAT](https://github.com/falvaro/seshat) is a handwritten math expression parser written in C++. The goal of this project is to write a simple, cross-platform program that uses SESHAT to recognise handwritten mathematical expressions. The program should allow training, so that it can support and learn new notations.

As a first step, try to create an application similar to [SESHAT's web app](http://cat.prhlt.upv.es/mer/) that works on Unix and Windows. As a second step, extend it with the capacity to be trained (with new symbols and different handwriting styles).

## Motivation to do this project

This project will help you improve your programming skills and, if you are successful, it is very likely that you will end up contributing to some of our research projects. Given that the number of handwritten mathematics recognizers is small, this project could
